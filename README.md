# Filmoteka website project

Hi 👋

We are students of a group called "GOFLIX" at GOIT Academy. 🚀

After finishing our JavaScript course , we had to consolidate 📌 the knowledge we gained and implement 📃 a graduation project for a week and a half.

🎨 The designers designed the layout of the team project for us - a responsive web site "Filmoteka".

🛠️ We were also given the TOR with a description of the functionality of the future site.

👨🎓 Eight people worked on the project. Each of them worked on specific tasks.

💻 Our goal was to make a site that matches the layout and also fulfills all the tasks from the TOR. The main purpose of the site is to display popular movies for the week, search for a particular movie, and organize a user library to manage movie lists.

## ✅ Throughout the project we:

- practiced teamwork skills with Git;
- continued to work with the Webpack builder;
- used the Scrum methodology;
- consolidated our knowledge of HTML and CSS.
- we consolidated our knowledge of JavaScript acquired during the course.

As a result of coordinated teamwork 🤝 we got our project: <a href='https://lefter011.github.io/command-project-filmoteka/index.html' target="_blank">⬇ Welcome! ⬇</a>
